# luiisms

One of my coworkers is exceptionally quotable, and it got to the point where we started documenting his phrases.
I made an api so the office could conveniently add and read from the collection.

Client coming soon!

## Tech Stack
Since this is a very simple application, I used it as an opportunity to try out various tech stacks.
I rebuilt it all a few times, and what's left is my favourite implementation.

The stuff I used:
- Prisma Server and Client
- GraphQL-Yoga (Typescript)
- Heroku (hosting database and Prisma Server)
